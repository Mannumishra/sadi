            <p>Donating to a cause or organization as part of a marriage ceremony can be a meaningful way to give back and make a positive impact. Here are a few ideas on how you can incorporate donations into your wedding:</p>
            <p><strong>Charitable Registry :</strong> Instead of a traditional wedding registry, create a charitable registry where guests can donate to a cause or organization of your choice in lieu of giving physical gifts.</p>
            <p><strong>Donation in Lieu of Favors :</strong> Rather than giving out wedding favors to guests, make a donation to a charity or nonprofit organization on behalf of your guests. You can display a sign or card at the reception explaining the donation.</p>
            <p><strong>Charity Wedding Registry :</strong>  Choose a specific charity or cause that is meaningful to you as a couple and encourage guests to make donations directly to that organization in honor of your wedding.</p>
            <p><strong>Donation in Honor of Guests :</strong>   Make a donation to a charity or cause for each guest attending your wedding. You can choose a charity that reflects your shared values as a couple.</p>
            <p><strong>Charitable Contributions in Ceremony :</strong> Incorporate a moment in your wedding ceremony where you make a donation or perform a charitable act together as a symbol of your commitment to giving back.</p>
            <p>
          Donating in marriage not only supports important causes but also adds a meaningful and philanthropic element to your wedding celebrations.</p>
